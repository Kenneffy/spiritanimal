# spiritanimal

Final WDI Project

Technologies used:
Datascraped from www.primalastrology.com using Node JS (cheerio/request)

HTML/CSS, Javascript, PostgreSQL. I used the following NPMs:
- express
- request
- cheerio
- express-handlebars
- body-parser
- method-override
- postgresql
- path

My interested in astrology and horoscopes led me to creating an application that determines your spirit animal by using your western horoscope and your eastern zodiac sign.

User will input their western horoscope (aquarius, aries & etc.) and input their eastern zodiac sign (horse, sheep). The two inputs will return a spirit animal (firefly, wolf, unicorn)

Challenges/Unsolved problems
- Data scraping with Node was a challenge
- Adding more content in the spirit animal description
- Add feature to determine eastern zodiac sign
- Have user stay on the application page when clicking on description instead of being redirected to primal astrology
